A GUI toolkit for Ndless-TI NSpire using SDL and Ndless libraries.

Documentation and more detailed description of the features to be done. Please have a llok a the wiki page here https://github.com/SlyVTT/Widget-for-TI-NSpire/wiki where you can find some examples of using the GUI Tollkit.

Current revision is 0.8beta.

You can try the toolkit by simply copying the Widget folder of this repository a the root of your TI Nspire to test the program.

This has only been tested on TI NSpire CX II-T CAS using firwmare/OS revision 5.2.0.711 and Ndless 5.2. If you try this toolkit with other pieces of hardware, please let me know in the issues page if it works or not. I haven't got all the corresponding machines, but maybe can I find a way to improve the code and make it works for most of you.

Please report bugs so what they can be corrected in next revisions.
